data driven testing

Reading the data from external resources(like database,(.jscon and .csv and.xlsx and.xml) ,json etc) test the data is called as data driver testing. 

comman data: The data is common to all testscript (ex:browser, username ,password and appln url)-it is stored in property file(.properties) bcz it is light weight
test data:the data which is specific to test script with respective module---we are using excel to store the testdata.


why

As automation rule says that we should not hardcode the data 
 we are following agile ,so the can change the req at any stage
changing/modifying the data is monotonous job ND maintainance is less


jar files 
to store common data and test data 

excel--apache poi
.properties--- java
.jscn---jackson
.xml---testng
JDBC ---- JDBC API
coomand prompt----MAVEN (plugin)


in mysql-----we cannot delete the previous data(disadvantage)


commands 

show database----database present in system

create database databasename ------create database sdet50

use databasename---it is enable the database

create table-----create table tablename

desc tablname-----//it is display in the from of table.----to describe the table.
